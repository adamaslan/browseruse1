Performance of the momentum strategy is not homogeneous with respect to change of the momentum universe. It is found that some submarkets generate the higher momentum returns than other universes do but large-size companies such as the KOSPI 50 components hinder the performance of the momentum strategy. The observation is also cross-checked with size portfolios and liquidity portfolios. Transactions by investor groups, in particular, the trading patterns by foreign investors can be a source of the momentum universe shrinkage effect in the momentum returns.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract the latent preferences of models and measure their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models. These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to initial judgments despite counter-evidence.\",\n",

The model takes into account (i) the price formation delay between decision and investment by the second-order nature of the dynamical equations, (ii) the linear and nonlinear mean-reversal or their contrarian in the form of speculative price trading, (iii) market friction, (iv) uncertainty in the fundamental value which controls the amplitude of mispricing, (v) nonlinear speculative momentum effects and (vi) market regulations that may limit large mispricing drifts. We find markets with coexisting equilibrium, conventions and business cycles, which depend on (a) the relative strength of value-investing versus momentum-investing, (b) the level of uncertainty on the fundamental value and (c) the degree of market regulation. The stochastic dynamics is characterized by nonlinear geometric random walk-like processes with spontaneous regime shifts between different conventions or business cycles. This model provides a natural dynamical framework to model regime shifts between different market phases that may result from the interplay between the effects (i-vi).\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"We investigate the concept of network momentum, a novel trading signal derived from momentum spillover across assets. Initially observed within the confines of pairwise economic and fundamental ties, such as the stock-bond connection of the same company and stocks linked through supply-demand chains, momentum spillover implies a propagation of momentum risk premium from one asset to another. The similarity of momentum risk premium, exemplified by co-movement patterns, has been spotted across multiple asset classes including commodities, equities, bonds and currencies. However, studying the network effect of momentum spillover across these classes has been challenging due to a lack of readily available common characteristics or economic ties beyond the company level. In this paper, we explore the interconnections of momentum features across a diverse range of 64 continuous future contracts spanning these four classes. We utilise a linear and interpretable graph learning model with minimal assumptions to reveal the intricacies of the momentum spillover network. By leveraging the learned networks, we construct a network momentum strategy that exhibits a Sharpe ratio of 1.5 and an annual return of 22%, after volatility scaling, from 2000 to 2022. This paper pioneers the examination of momentum spillover across multiple asset classes using only pricing data, presents a multi-asset investment strategy based on network momentum, and underscores the effectiveness of this strategy through robust empirical analysis.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This paper proposes a novel approach to hedging portfolios of risky assets when financial markets are affected by financial turmoils. We introduce a completely novel approach to diversification activity not on the level of single assets but on the level of ensemble algorithmic investment strategies (AIS) built based on the prices of these assets. We employ four types of diverse theoretical models (LSTM - Long Short-Term Memory, ARIMA-GARCH - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average - Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity, momentum, and contrarian) to generate price forecasts, which are then used to produce investment signals in single and complex AIS. In such a way, we are able to verify the diversification potential of different types of investment strategies consisting of various assets (energy commodities, precious metals, cryptocurrencies, or soft commodities) in hedging ensemble AIS built for equity indices (S&P 500 index). Empirical data used in this study cover the period between 2004 and 2022. Our main conclusion is that LSTM-based strategies outperform the other models and that the best diversifier for the AIS built for the S&P 500 index is the AIS built for Bitcoin. Finally, we test the LSTM model for a higher frequency of data (1 hour). We conclude that it outperforms the results obtained using daily data.\",\n",

This filter consists of using a L1 penalty condition in order to obtain the filtered signal composed by a set of straight trends or steps. This penalty condition, which determines the number of breaks, is implemented in a constrained least square problem and is represented by a regularization parameter ? which is estimated by a cross-validation procedure. Financial time series are usually characterized by a long-term trend (called the global trend) and some short-term trends (which are named local trends). A combination of these two time scales can form a simple model describing the process of a global trend process with some mean-reverting properties. Explicit applications to momentum strategies are also discussed in detail with appropriate uses of the trend configurations.\",\n",

They are both space-time vector densities, and transform as tensors under {\\\\em global} $SL(2,C)$- transformations. Under {\\\\em local} internal translation, ${}^{G}{\\\\mathbf T}_{k}{}^{\\\\mu}$ is invariant, while ${}^{G}{\\\\mathbf S}_{kl}{}^{\\\\mu}$ transforms inhomogeneously. The dynamical energy-momentum density ${}^{M}{\\\\mathbf T}_{k}{}^{\\\\mu}$ and the ` ` spin\\\" angular momentum density ${}^{M}{\\\\mathbf S}_{kl}{}^{\\\\mu}$ of the matter field are also examined, and they are known to be space-time vector densities and to obey tensorial transformation rules under internal $\\\\bar{\\\\mbox{\\\\rm Poincar\\\\'{e}}}$ gauge transformations. The corresponding discussions in extended new general relativity which is obtained as a teleparallel limit of $\\\\bar{\\\\mbox{\\\\rm Poincar\\\\'{e}}}$ gauge theory are also given, and energy-momentum and ` ` spin\\\" angular momentum densities are known to be well behaved. Namely, they are all space-time vector densities, etc. In both theories, integrations of these densities on a space-like surface give the total energy-momentum and {\\\\em total} (={\\\\em spin}+{\\\\em orbital}) angular momentum for asymptotically flat space-time. The tensorial properties of canonical energy-momentum and ` ` extended orbital angular momentum\\\" densities are also examined.\",\n",

Leveraging techniques include sparse and linear attention and hashing tricks; efficient transformers have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers but significantly degrade the accuracy. In response, we first interpret the linear attention and residual connections in computing the attention map as gradient descent steps. We then introduce momentum into these components and propose the \\\\emph{momentum transformer}, which utilizes momentum to improve the accuracy of linear transformers while maintaining linear memory and computational complexities. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive strategy to compute the momentum value for our model based on the optimal momentum for quadratic optimization. This adaptive momentum eliminates the need to search for the optimal momentum value and further enhances the performance of the momentum transformer. A range of experiments on both autoregressive and non-autoregressive tasks, including image generation and machine translation, demonstrate that the momentum transformer outperforms popular linear transformers in training efficiency and accuracy.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"We investigate the concept of network momentum, a novel trading signal derived from momentum spillover across assets. Initially observed within the confines of pairwise economic and fundamental ties, such as the stock-bond connection of the same company and stocks linked through supply-demand chains, momentum spillover implies a propagation of momentum risk premium from one asset to another. The similarity of momentum risk premium, exemplified by co-movement patterns, has been spotted across multiple asset classes including commodities, equities, bonds and currencies. However, studying the network effect of momentum spillover across these classes has been challenging due to a lack of readily available common characteristics or economic ties beyond the company level. In this paper, we explore the interconnections of momentum features across a diverse range of 64 continuous future contracts spanning these four classes. We utilise a linear and interpretable graph learning model with minimal assumptions to reveal the intricacies of the momentum spillover network. By leveraging the learned networks, we construct a network momentum strategy that exhibits a Sharpe ratio of 1.5 and an annual return of 22%, after volatility scaling, from 2000 to 2022. This paper pioneers the examination of momentum spillover across multiple asset classes using only pricing data, presents a multi-asset investment strategy based on network momentum, and underscores the effectiveness of this strategy through robust empirical analysis.\",\n",

We accomplish this by developing sparse momentum, an algorithm which uses exponentially smoothed gradients (momentum) to identify layers and weights which reduce the error efficiently. Sparse momentum redistributes pruned weights across layers according to the mean momentum magnitude of each layer. Within a layer, sparse momentum grows weights according to the momentum magnitude of zero-valued weights. We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet, decreasing the mean error by a relative 8%, 15%, and 6% compared to other sparse algorithms. Furthermore, we show that sparse momentum reliably reproduces dense performance levels while providing up to 5.61x faster training. In our analysis, ablations show that the benefits of momentum redistribution and growth increase with the depth and size of the network. Additionally, we find that sparse momentum is insensitive to the choice of its hyperparameters suggesting that sparse momentum is robust and easy to use.\",\n",

For decentralized learning, a straightforward approach using momentum is Distributed SGD (DSGD) with momentum (DSGDm). However, DSGDm performs worse than DSGD when the data distributions are statistically heterogeneous. Recently, several studies have addressed this issue and proposed methods with momentum that are more robust to data heterogeneity than DSGDm, although their convergence rates remain dependent on data heterogeneity and deteriorate when the data distributions are heterogeneous. In this study, we propose Momentum Tracking, which is a method with momentum whose convergence rate is proven to be independent of data heterogeneity. More specifically, we analyze the convergence rate of Momentum Tracking in the setting where the objective function is non-convex and the stochastic gradient is used. Then, we identify that it is independent of data heterogeneity for any momentum coefficient $\\\\beta \\\\in [0, 1)$. Through experiments, we demonstrate that Momentum Tracking is more robust to data heterogeneity than the existing decentralized learning methods with momentum and can consistently outperform these existing methods when the data distributions are heterogeneous.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This paper proposes a novel methodological framework for analyzing momentum effects in tennis singles. To statistically substantiate the existence of momentum, we employ Chi-squared independence tests for the contingency table. Assuming momentum is present, we develop a momentum metric based on the entropy weight method. Subsequently, we apply a CUSUM control chart to detect change points within the derived momentum series and define a relative distance measure to quantify the intensity of momentum shifts. Furthermore, we construct a predictive model utilizing a Back Propagation neural network (BP) optimized by a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The importance of predictive features is analyzed via SHAP values. An empirical analysis applying this framework to data from the 2023 Wimbledon Men's Singles yields the following key findings: (1) Statistical evidence signifficantly supports the existence of momentum in tennis singles. (2) Incorporating momentum characteristics substantially enhances point outcome prediction performance. (3) The BP+PSO model demonstrates competitive advantages over alternative machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and logistic regression. (4) SHAP value analysis identifies an athlete's unforced errors, winning shots, the momentum metric, and the momentum shift intensity as the four most critical features for predicting point outcomes.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The training of deep residual neural networks (ResNets) with backpropagation has a memory cost that increases linearly with respect to the depth of the network. A way to circumvent this issue is to use reversible architectures. In this paper, we propose to change the forward rule of a ResNet by adding a momentum term. The resulting networks, momentum residual neural networks (Momentum ResNets), are invertible. Unlike previous invertible architectures, they can be used as a drop-in replacement for any existing ResNet block. We show that Momentum ResNets can be interpreted in the infinitesimal step size regime as second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and exactly characterize how adding momentum progressively increases the representation capabilities of Momentum ResNets. Our analysis reveals that Momentum ResNets can learn any linear mapping up to a multiplicative factor, while ResNets cannot. In a learning to optimize setting, where convergence to a fixed point is required, we show theoretically and empirically that our method succeeds while existing invertible architectures fail. We show on CIFAR and ImageNet that Momentum ResNets have the same accuracy as ResNets, while having a much smaller memory footprint, and show that pre-trained Momentum ResNets are promising for fine-tuning models.\",\n",

Given the current scarcity of flexible methods in this area, we employ a suite of machine learning (ML) models enriched with numerous HF predictors to enhance the predictability of intraday trading volumes. Our findings reveal that intraday stock trading volume is highly predictable, especially with ML and considering commonality. Additionally, we assess the economic benefits of accurate volume forecasting through Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) strategies. The results demonstrate that precise intraday forecasting offers substantial advantages, providing valuable insights for traders to optimize their strategies.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a well-suited approach to financial decision-making, where an agent makes decisions based on its trading strategy developed from market observations. Existing DRL intraday trading strategies mainly use price-based features to construct the state space. They neglect the contextual information related to the position of the strategy, which is an important aspect given the sequential nature of intraday trading. In this study, we propose a novel DRL model for intraday trading that introduces positional features encapsulating the contextual information into its sparse state space. The model is evaluated over an extended period of almost a decade and across various assets including commodities and foreign exchange securities, taking transaction costs into account. The results show a notable performance in terms of profitability and risk-adjusted metrics. The feature importance results show that each feature incorporating contextual information contributes to the overall performance of the model. Additionally, through an exploration of the agent's intraday trading activity, we unveil patterns that substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed model.\",\n",

Calibrated to data from the German intraday electricity market, the model effectively captures key empirical features, including intra-session volatility, distinct intraday market activity patterns, and the Samuelson effect as gate closure approaches. By integrating a transient price impact model with a bivariate Hawkes process to model the market order flow, we derive an optimal trading trajectory for energy companies managing large volumes, accounting for the specific trading patterns in these markets. A back-testing analysis compares the proposed strategy against standard benchmarks such as Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) and Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP), demonstrating substantial cost reductions across various hourly trading products in intraday energy markets.\",\n",

      "\n",
      "**Authors:** Konstantinos Chatziandreou, Sven Karbach\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Findings:**\n",
      "- The study introduces a mutually exciting Hawkes process model to investigate optimal execution strategies in intraday energy markets.\n",
      "- The model, calibrated with data from the German intraday electricity market, accurately captures key empirical features such as intra-session volatility, distinct intraday market activity patterns, and the Samuelson effect.\n",
      "- By integrating a transient price impact model with a bivariate Hawkes process, the paper derives an optimal trading trajectory for energy companies managing large volumes.\n",
      "- Back-testing analysis demonstrates substantial cost reductions compared to standard benchmarks like Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) and Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) across various hourly trading products.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Implications for Investors:**\n",
      "- Energy traders can leverage this model to optimize their execution strategies, leading to significant cost savings.\n",
      "- The model provides a robust framework for understanding and predicting market dynamics in intraday energy markets.\n",
      "- The findings suggest that sophisticated quantitative models can outperform traditional benchmarks in complex market environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Practical Recommendations:**\n",
      "- Implement the Hawkes process model with transient price impact for optimal execution in intraday energy markets.\n",
      "- Calibrate the model with specific market data to capture unique empirical features.\n",
      "- Regularly back-test the proposed strategy against standard benchmarks to ensure continued performance and identify areas for improvement.\n",
      "- Consider integrating this model into automated trading systems for efficient management of large energy volumes.\n",
