## Research Batch 1 (2025-09-06 17:48)

I have successfully analyzed the three academic papers on momentum trading/investing as requested. I have generated a Markdown summary for each paper and compiled them into `paper_summaries.md`. I have also created a structured JSON output for each paper and compiled them into `results.json`. Both files are attached for your review.

**Summary of Findings:**

**Paper 1: Momentum universe shrinkage effect in price momentum**
- **Key Findings:** Momentum strategy performance varies across subuniverses of KOSPI 200. Large-size companies negatively impact performance. Foreign investor trading patterns are a potential source of this effect.
- **Implications for Investors:** Consider specific market segments; smaller-cap or less liquid segments might yield better momentum returns.

**Paper 2: Your AI, Not Your View: The Bias of LLMs in Investment Analysis**
- **Key Findings:** LLMs exhibit knowledge conflicts and confirmation bias in investment analysis, showing preferences for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies.
- **Implications for Investors:** Be aware of inherent biases in LLM-based investment recommendations; do not solely rely on them.

**Paper 3: Nonlinear Dynamical Model of Regime Switching Between Conventions and Business Cycles**
- **Key Findings:** A dynamical model shows markets with coexisting equilibrium, conventions, and business cycles, influenced by value vs. momentum investing, uncertainty, and regulation.

# Momentum universe shrinkage effect in price momentum

**Authors:** Jaehyung Choi, Sungsoo Choi, Wonseok Kang

**Key Findings:**
- The performance of momentum strategy is not uniform across different momentum universes, specifically subuniverses of the KOSPI 200.
- Some submarkets yield higher momentum returns, while large-size companies (e.g., KOSPI 50 components) negatively impact momentum strategy performance.
- This observation is consistent across size and liquidity portfolios.
- Trading patterns by foreign investors are identified as a potential source of the momentum universe shrinkage effect.

**Implications for Investors:**
- Investors should carefully consider the specific market segments or 'universes' when implementing momentum strategies, as performance can vary significantly.
- Focusing on smaller-cap or less liquid segments might yield better momentum returns compared to large-cap stocks.
- Understanding the trading behavior of different investor groups, especially foreign investors, can provide insights into momentum drivers.

**Practical Recommendations:**
- Implement momentum strategies with a focus on sub-universes that exclude large-cap stocks.
- Analyze investor group transaction data to identify potential momentum-driving forces.
- Diversify momentum strategies across different market segments to optimize returns.


# Your AI, Not Your View: The Bias of LLMs in Investment Analysis

**Authors:** Hoyoung Lee, Junhyuk Seo, Suhwan Park, Junhyeong Lee, Wonbin Ahn, Chanyeol Choi, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, Yongjae Lee

**Key Findings:**
- LLMs exhibit inherent biases in investment analysis, particularly a consistent preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies.
- These biases stem from conflicts between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data.
- LLMs often demonstrate confirmation bias, clinging to initial judgments even when presented with counter-evidence.
- An experimental framework can quantitatively analyze confirmation bias in LLM-based investment analysis.

**Implications for Investors:**
- Investors relying on LLM-based investment services should be aware of potential inherent biases that may not align with their own preferences or the financial institution's strategy.
- LLM recommendations might be skewed towards large-cap stocks and contrarian views, potentially leading to suboptimal or misaligned investment decisions.
- The presence of confirmation bias in LLMs suggests that their recommendations might not adapt effectively to new, contradictory market information.

**Practical Recommendations:**
- Implement robust validation and calibration processes for LLM-based investment tools to mitigate inherent biases.
- Combine LLM insights with human oversight and diverse analytical approaches to ensure balanced and reliable investment recommendations.
- Regularly test LLMs against various market scenarios and data to identify and correct persistent biases.
- Develop mechanisms to explicitly define and align LLM preferences with investor or institutional objectives.

# Nonlinear Dynamical Model of Regime Switching Between Conventions and Business Cycles

**Authors:** V. I. Yukalov, D. Sornette, E. P. Yukalova

**Key Findings:**
- Introduces a non-equilibrium continuous-time dynamical model for asset prices, considering heterogeneous agents, uncertainty, and regulatory constraints.
- Incorporates factors like price formation delay, linear/nonlinear mean-reversal, market friction, uncertainty in fundamental value, nonlinear speculative momentum effects, and market regulations.
- Identifies coexisting equilibrium, conventions, and business cycles influenced by the relative strength of value-investing vs. momentum-investing, uncertainty in fundamental value, and market regulation.
- Characterizes stochastic dynamics by nonlinear geometric random walk-like processes with spontaneous regime shifts between different market phases.

**Implications for Investors:**
- Understanding the interplay of various market forces (value vs. momentum, uncertainty, regulation) can help anticipate regime shifts.
- The model suggests that market phases are not static and can switch dynamically, requiring adaptive investment strategies.
- Investors should be aware of the potential for nonlinear speculative momentum effects and how they interact with market regulations.

**Practical Recommendations:**
- Develop dynamic trading strategies that can adapt to regime shifts between different market phases (equilibrium, conventions, business cycles).
- Incorporate measures of uncertainty in fundamental value and regulatory changes into investment models.
- Consider the relative strength of value-investing versus momentum-investing in different market conditions to optimize strategy allocation.
