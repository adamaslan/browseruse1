      "The article discusses the rebalancing of the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) and its implications for momentum investing. Key takeaways include:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Portfolio Construction:** The MTUM ETF's rebalancing process involves identifying stocks with strong momentum over the past 6-12 months, excluding the most recent month to avoid short-term reversals. The rebalance in November 2020 saw a significant shift from growth-oriented stocks (like FAANG) to more cyclical and value-oriented sectors (e.g., industrials, materials, financials), indicating that momentum strategies can adapt to changing market leadership. The article highlights that momentum is not a static factor and its composition changes based on market dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Trading Costs:** While not explicitly detailed, the frequent rebalancing (semi-annually for MTUM) inherent in momentum strategies implies higher trading costs compared to buy-and-hold strategies. The article indirectly touches upon this by discussing the 'huge rebalancing' and the associated shifts, which would necessitate transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Holding Periods:** The momentum factor typically considers performance over 6-12 months, suggesting relatively short to medium holding periods for individual stocks within a momentum portfolio, as positions are adjusted based on recent performance. The semi-annual rebalancing of MTUM reinforces this.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Scalability:** The article does not directly address the scalability of momentum strategies. However, the discussion around a large ETF like MTUM suggests that momentum strategies can be implemented on a large scale, though potential market impact costs for very large trades are not discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Adaptation to Changing Market Dynamics:** The core of the article demonstrates how momentum strategies adapt. The rebalancing of MTUM from growth to value/cyclical stocks in response to changing market conditions (e.g., vaccine news, economic recovery expectations) is a prime example. This shows that momentum is dynamic and follows where the market is performing best, thus adapting to new market regimes and leadership.\n",

      "*   In May 2022, the fund piled into energy, consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare stocks, reflecting a value tilt.\n",
      "*   In May 2023, it swung firmly back into growth territory, with significant increases in tech (from 3% to 27%), communication services (from 2% to 10%), and consumer discretionary (from 7% to 14%), while decreasing healthcare (from 39% to 19%) and energy (from 24% to 5%).\n",
