# Momentum Investing Research Report

*Generated on: 2025-09-05 20:52:59*

The research on 'momentum investing' is partially complete. I have successfully extracted the following information:

## Key Findings (Partial)

### Investing.com:
*   **Book Review: Dual Momentum Investing** (Oct 27, 2014) - Review of Gary Antonacci's book, covering risk premia harvesting and optimal momentum investing.
*   **Momentum Vs. Value Investing** (Jul 20, 2012) - An article discussing the differences between momentum and value investing.

### Investopedia:
*   A list of search results for 'momentum investing' was found, including titles and links. However, publication dates and brief summaries were not available for these results.

### MarketWatch:
*   No relevant news articles or analysis specifically related to 'momentum investing' were found.

## Implications for Investors (Partial)

Based on the limited data, early insights suggest that 'momentum investing' involves strategies like dual momentum and is often contrasted with 'value investing'. Further research is needed to understand how these strategies adapt to changing market dynamics.

## Practical Recommendations (Partial)

At this stage, no comprehensive practical recommendations can be made due to incomplete data. More research from the remaining sources is required.

**Remaining Sources to Search:**
- Seeking Alpha
- The Motley Fool
- Yahoo Finance
- Zacks
- Morningstar
- InvestorPlace
- Barron’s
- CFA Institute Blog
- SSRN
- NBER
- AQR Capital blogs
- Research Affiliates insights

The task is incomplete as many sources still need to be searched and their information extracted and processed.
