Luckily, the people at Irving Bottle are prepared for this. When it comes to the new movement of natural wines, one could say the whole movement should be speaking in such a tone. A movement that is clearly going to gain steam in 2019, natural wines do not come with a specific certification one has to pay for necessarily, like a wine that is certified organic or biodynamic for example and thus, the definition of natural is open to interpretation. While the question of what makes a wine natural is clearly an interesting one, another great question is: why is everybody freaking out over natural wines? There are several good answers to that question. You could answer that question by mentioning all the nods to minimalism that comes with natural wine like the lack of or minimal use of sulfites, lack of advanced technology, or lack of filtration. Another way you could answer that question would be to mention how natural wine uses more old school techniques in the wine making process. Lets not forget all the cool labels they come with, boutique distributors, stores, and restaurants all dedicated to natural wine. However, none of these are the best reasons to freak out about natural wine. What is the best reason? The unique funky taste. When I awkwardly asked an employee at Irving Bottle, located on...Irving Ave (who would have guessed???) in Bushwick Brooklyn, if they had a funky yet affordable natural red, I was delighted to find out that this neighborhood gem did indeed carry an array of such wines. The wine they suggested to me was the Coup de Canon produced by Gregory Leclerc of Domaine Chahut et Prodiges located in the Loire Valley.\\n</result>\", include_extracted_content_only_once=True, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Data appended to file articles.json successfully.', extracted_content='Data appended to file articles.json successfully.', include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Successfully replaced all occurrences of \"- [ ] Return to the homepage\" with \"- [x] Return to the homepage\" in file todo.md', extracted_content='Successfully replaced all occurrences of \"- [ ] Return to the homepage\" with \"- [x] Return to the homepage\" in file todo.md', include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory=None, extracted_content='Navigated back', include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Clicked element with index 9', extracted_content=None, include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata={'click_x': 1190.33203125, 'click_y': 297.0, 'new_tab_opened': False}, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Extracted content from https://www.drinksfoodlife.com/tealove for query: Extract the article title, the full URL of the page, and the main content of the article.\\nContent saved to file system: Extracted content saved to file extracted_content_1.md successfully. and displayed in <read_state>.', extracted_content='<url>\\nhttps://www.drinksfoodlife.com/tealove\\n</url>\\n<query>\\nExtract the article title, the full URL of the page, and the main content of the article.\\n</query>\\n<result>\\nArticle Title: 5 Reasons Why You Should Drink Loose Teas\\nFull URL: Not available in the provided content.\\nMain Content:\\nLots to say about the tea in its loosest form and genmaicha...and Porto Rico Importing Company which dates back to 1907. Here are 5 reasons why loose tea is great!\\n1. **Lots of flavor:** Loose tea leaves are larger and less processed than tea found in bags, which means they retain more of their natural oils and flavor.\\n2. **Higher quality:** Loose tea is often made from better quality tea leaves compared to the broken leaves and dust found in tea bags.\\n3. **Health benefits:** Loose tea contains antioxidants, polyphenols, and other beneficial compounds that can help support overall health and well-being.\\n4. **Customizable:** Loose tea allows for more control over the strength and flavor of your tea. You can adjust the amount of tea leaves and steeping time to your liking.\\n5. **Eco-friendly:** Loose tea generates less waste than tea bags, which are often made with non-biodegradable materials like nylon or polyester.\\n</result>', include_extracted_content_only_once=True, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Data appended to file articles.json successfully.', extracted_content='Data appended to file articles.json successfully.', include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Successfully replaced all occurrences of \"- [ ] Return to the homepage\" with \"- [x] Return to the homepage\" in file todo.md', extracted_content='Successfully replaced all occurrences of \"- [ ] Return to the homepage\" with \"- [x] Return to the homepage\" in file todo.md', include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory=None, extracted_content='Navigated back', include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error='Failed to click element 13: Element index 13 not found in browser state', attachments=None, long_term_memory=None, extracted_content=None, include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Scrolled down the page by one page', extracted_content='üîç Scrolled down the page by one page', include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Clicked element with index 1', extracted_content=None, include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata={'click_x': 315.0, 'click_y': 1.0, 'new_tab_opened': False}, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Extracted content from https://www.drinksfoodlife.com/tasty-tech-bytes for query: Extract the article title, the full URL of the page, and the main content of the article.\\nContent saved to file system: Extracted content saved to file extracted_content_2.md successfully. and displayed in <read_state>.', extracted_content=\"<url>\\nhttps://www.drinksfoodlife.com/tasty-tech-bytes\\n</url>\\n<query>\\nExtract the article title, the full URL of the page, and the main content of the article.\\n</query>\\n<result>\\n**Article Title**: Tasty Tech Bytes - Your Guide to AI and Modern Development\\n**Full URL of the page**: www.tastytechbytes.com\\n**Main content of the article**:\\nWe are pleased to introduce Tasty Tech Bytes, your go-to publication for the latest in technology, artificial intelligence, and software development.

With so many styles of beer available it's easy to make an appreciative glance at the noticeably hip design of baby daddy and then get distracted by some other beer in the vast array of beers in the world. Ahh...so many tasty beer fish in the sea. Indeed, the anonymity of any beer on the shelf in a major city in the US is akin to the modern era of dating. With so many IPAs (not to mention session IPAs) on the market, it‚Äôs easy to swipe left on any beer these days, but Baby Daddy seems to be having more success than the rest of the flock these days. The good tidings have most likely arisen because of the full-bodied IPA taste with a very noticeable grapefruit kick that is still incredibly easy to drink. A quality product coupled with cool packaging and branding that is emblematic of Speakeasy ales and lagers ensures Baby Daddy IPA will be a bevy daddies, mommies, and the whole over 21-year-old family will be enjoying for a long time.

Santa Rita‚Äôs 120 Carm√©n√®re\\nWhile Carm√©n√®re is not one of the most popular types of wine out there it certainly a solid bodied red that is the pride of Chile. What makes Santa Rita‚Äôs Carm√©n√®re stand out from the croud is its uniquely pleasent mouthfeel characterized by a deep fruitiness. Is it sweet? Yes, but still elegant and with a strong nose full of red fruit and crisp spices. Especially recommended for the budding red wine enthusiast looking to diversify their palate, the 120 Carm√©n√®re evokes the nostalgia for Chilean culture through its taste as well as the ‚Äò120‚Äô series name, which is titled after Do√±a Paula Jaraquemada who hid 120 Chilean revolutionaries during their war for independence from Spain.\\n\\n2) Fetzer Valley Oaks Cabernet Sauvignon\\nWith grapes grown in the valleys of Mendocino County, Fetzer‚Äôs Valley Oaks offers delightful black currant aromas of aromas of higher priced Cabernet Sauvignons at an extremely affordable cost. There is plenty to like about this wine with its rich body and smooth finish. Owned by Latin American wine giants Concho y Toro, Fetzer has created a lovely Cabernet Sauvignon in the foothills of Northern California.\\n\\n3) Casillero del Diablo Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon\\nDescribed by the wine maker as ‚ÄúMedium bodied with silky tannins‚Äù the Casillero del Diablo Reserva is yet another solid bet for those looking for value at a modest price. Rich in cherry flavors, this Cabernet Sauvignon sitting beautifully in the glass with its dark red color foreshadows its great taste just by its appearance alone. Finding a solid bottle of red wine at good price is not always the easiest thing, but these three reds will not do you wrong. They may not be the best examples of their specific type of red but they are definitely worth a try.\\n</result>', include_extracted_content_only_once=True, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Data appended to file articles.json successfully.', extracted_content='Data appended to file articles.json successfully.', include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Successfully replaced all occurrences of \"- [ ] Return to the homepage\" with \"- [x] Return to the homepage\" in file todo.md', extracted_content='Successfully replaced all occurrences of \"- [ ] Return to the homepage\" with \"- [x] Return to the homepage\" in file todo.md', include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory=None, extracted_content='Navigated back', include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Clicked element with index 2', extracted_content=None, include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata={'click_x': 735.0, 'click_y': 70.0, 'new_tab_opened': False}, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='<url>\\nhttps://www.drinksfoodlife.com/coyoacan\\n</url>\\n<query>\\nExtract the article title, the full URL of the page, and the main content of the article.\\n</query>\\n<result>\\nArticle Title: Getting Deep in Coyoacan\\nFull URL: Not available in the provided content.\\nMain Content: I love Coyoacan.

The exhibit showcases replicas from Frida Kahlo\\'s Casa Azul, her garden, and the plants of Mexico, all of which were central to Kahlo\\'s life and art. THE exhibit displays much of her personal style and portrayal of Mexican culture. The Casa Azul, where she was born and raised, is now a museum in Mexico City that houses her personal belongings, artwork, and a collection of Mexican folk art. The Naples Botanical Garden\\'s Frida Exhibit features replicas of some of Kahlo\\'s most iconic works, including her self-portraits, her famous portraits of Diego Rivera, and her paintings of Mexican culture and nature. The exhibit also includes replicas of Kahlo\\'s personal belongings, such as her traditional Mexican dresses, her jewelry, and her household items. One of the most impressive aspects of the exhibit is the recreation of Kahlo\\'s garden. The garden was a vital part of Kahlo\\'s life, and she spent countless hours tending to it, planting new species of plants and flowers and creating beautiful arrangements. The garden was also a source of inspiration for many of her paintings, including her famous painting, \"The Two Fridas.\" The Naples Botanical Garden\\'s replica of Kahlo\\'s garden includes a variety of plants and flowers that were native to Mexico, such as marigolds, dahlias, and Mexican sunflowers. The garden is arranged in a way that mirrors the layout of Kahlo\\'s original garden, with paths lined with stones and pots filled with brightly colored flowers. The exhibit also features a collection of plants from Mexico that were important to Kahlo, including the agave plant, which is used to make tequila, and the prickly pear cactus, which was a staple food source for the indigenous people of Mexico. These plants are not only beautiful, but they also offer visitors a glimpse into the culture and history of Mexico.\\n</result>', include_extracted_content_only_once=True, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Data appended to file articles.json successfully.', extracted_content='Data appended to file articles.json successfully.', include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Successfully replaced all occurrences of \"- [ ] Return to the homepage\" with \"- [x] Return to the homepage\" in file todo.md', extracted_content='Successfully replaced all occurrences of \"- [ ] Return to the homepage\" with \"- [x] Return to the homepage\" in file todo.md', include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory=None, extracted_content='Navigated back', include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Clicked element with index 8', extracted_content=None, include_extracted_content_only_once=False, metadata={'click_x': 1155.0, 'click_y': 346.0, 'new_tab_opened': False}, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=False, success=None, error=None, attachments=None, long_term_memory='Extracted content from https://www.drinksfoodlife.com/mole for query: Extract the article title, the full URL of the page, and the main content of the article.\\nContent saved to file system: Extracted content saved to file extracted_content_9.md successfully. and displayed in <read_state>.', extracted_content='<url>\\nhttps://www.drinksfoodlife.com/mole\\n</url>\\n<query>\\nExtract the article title, the full URL of the page, and the main content of the article.\\n</query>\\n<result>\\nArticle Title: On the Love of Mole at Meson Antugua Santa Catarina\\nFull URL: The full URL of the page is not available in the provided content.\\nMain Content: I love Mole.

Raki is also a symbol of Turkish culture and hospitality, often served with meze and enjoyed in a similar way of sharing a bottle of wine with friends.\\nTurkish Grill in Sunnyside Queens is a great place to enjoy Raki. It costs only 12 dollars and comes with this elegant and efficient set up. You can also order delicious Turkish dishes, such as kebabs, manti, lahmacun, and baklava, to pair with your drink.

It‚Äôs like my memory of my grandpa eating pumpkin pie as I eat pumpkin pie with my mom‚Äôs homemade whipped cr√®me, except it‚Äôs delicious cafecitos and ceviche. It‚Äôs also known as the world‚Äôs most famous Cuban restaurant, but that resonates with me because it has actually touched the hearts of many in the Cuban and greater Latino population in Miami regardless of income level. They have a location in Little Haiti and in the Miami Airport, which makes MIA one of the more culturally relevant airports in the U.S., in competition with DEN, to name one.\\n\\nFounded in 1971 by Felipe A. Valls Sr., Caf√© Versailles began as a modest family-run establishment on Calle Ocho in Miami‚Äôs vibrant Cuban community. Over the decades, it transformed into a cultural landmark‚Äîa meeting place where Cuban exiles and locals gathered to share not only authentic food but also memories, political debates, and stories of a bygone era. Its evolution mirrors Miami‚Äôs own transformation, expanding to include an on-site bakery and even a branch at Miami International Airport, each extension celebrating the legacy of a restaurant that has been as much about community as it has been about cuisine.\\n\\nCaf√© Versailles is celebrated for its rich and authentic Cuban fare that masterfully blends tradition with innovative touches. The menu boasts iconic dishes like ropa vieja, vaca frita, and roast pork seasoned with signature Cuban mojo, alongside a range of beloved treats‚Äîfrom perfectly crafted cafecitos and pastelitos to the classic Cuban sandwich. Every dish is prepared with meticulous care and locally sourced ingredients, ensuring that each bite encapsulates the warmth, passion, and heritage of Cuban culture.
